            also : such material together with supplementary substances (as minerals, vitamins, and condiments).food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy. The absorption and utilization of food by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion.
             Plants, which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source. 
            Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for other animals.
             To learn more about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to organism, see food chain.

        <p>Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair,
             and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. 
            Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function.
             The energy in food is measured in units called calories.
             Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support.
              Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. 
              The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

             Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
              Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption.
               The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
